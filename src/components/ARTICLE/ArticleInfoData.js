	description: `While there are many different reasons for dry eyes—including staring at your computer screen all day—a more serious culprit is Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the tear-secreting glands in your eyes, leading to a reduction in tear production and chronic dry eye issues, according to the Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation. It can also cause your mouth to become dry.

	description: `Are you usually searching for an extra sweater or a blanket to wrap yourself in? When you have low thyroid production, it can result in feeling cold. According to Harvard Medical School, that's due to the fact that your slowed-down cells are burning less energy, resulting in your body producing less heat. Because of that, you might often find yourself reaching for a sweatshirt when everyone else seems to be happy with the temperature.

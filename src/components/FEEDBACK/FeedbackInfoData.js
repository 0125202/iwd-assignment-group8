        All patients receiving private hospital-based care should be given the opportunity to fill in a feedback survey, just as they are in the OnlineDoc.
        The responses are sent to OnlineDoc, which we use to calculate the percentage of patients which responded positively to the survey questions in each area.
        While this cannot provide as much detail as a written review, it does provide a good overview of the experience of a range of patients.
